I am updating ITH v3 with recent engine definitions from Visual Novel Reader, much 'fatter' program which does not suit my needs

Do not expect much, I know only basics of C, so there could be unexpected bugs.

I am not going to claim any right to existing code. Use it as you like, and if you can improve it any way - I would be glad to hand over ITH development.

Updated engine code comes from <a href='http://sakuradite.com/wiki/en/VNR'>Visual Novel Reader</a> - a project which is actively developed by it's author but the program is too bulky for me (several hundred mbs and unnecessary modules I would <b>never</b> use). I don't claim any author rights to algorithms, it's just a mix of kaosu's and jichi's programs, taking best from each one and trying not to make it in a heavyweight app.

NOTE: this only containg generic engine detection from VNR, in every respect it's the same old buggy ITH
